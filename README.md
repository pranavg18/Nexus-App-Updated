# Nexus-App
Nexus App is a minimal, backend-only chat platform built using Spring Boot. It is designed to mimic WhatsApp-like messaging functionality without a database. Instead, all the data (users, conversations, group chats, message metadata) is stored in JSON files.

## About
Nexus App is a lightweight communication backend that supports:
- User registration, authentication, logout, and deletion
- One-on-one direct messaging (DM) between users
- Group creation, joining, and group messaging
- Clearing chats
- Deleting messages for everyone, both in DMs as well as in group chats
- JSON file-based database system

Swagger UI was used for easy testing.

## Features
### User Management
- Register new users
- Strong password validation
- Login/Logout
- Delete account
- Tracks active login sessions

### Direct Messaging
- Send message to any registered user
- Stores conversation in `<user1>_<user2>.json` file

- Message timestamps
- Delete a specific message for everyone
- Clear chat only for yourself

### Group Chat
- Create groups
- Join groups
- Send group messages
- Retrieve group history
- Delete messages in groups
- Clear group chat only for yourself

### JSON Files
Stored inside:
- `/data/users.json`
- `/data/<user1>_<user2>.json`
- `/data/groups.json`
- `/data/group_{groupName}.json`

### Utilities
- Used Swagger UI for local testing
- Password validation regex
- Safe read/write operations with ObjectMapper
- Local login session tracking

## Tech Stack
### Backend
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Spring Context
- Lombok
- Jackson (ObjectMapper for JSON)
### Frontend
- None (API-only backend)
- Swagger UI used for testing requests
### Database
- Pure JSON file storage
### Other Tools
- Swagger/OpenAPI
- Maven build system
- IntelliJ IDEA

## Demo
### Swagger UI - Home Page Preview
![Swagger Homepage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/262bc634-da16-40fd-9d6e-3714ee8c3d54)
This is a high-level view of what our backend application looks like on Swagger UI. For more information regarding all the features and how they work, refer to the demo video below.

## Installation
Run the following commands in terminal.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/htserhsluk/Nexus-App
cd nexus-app
```

### 2. Ensure Java (atleast 17+) and Maven are installed
```java -version
mvn -version
```

### 3. Install Lombok plugin (IntelliJ)
- Go to File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Search "Lombok"
- Install and restart
- Enable annotation processing:
 - Settings -> Build -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors -> Enable

### 4. Run the application
- Using IntelliJL
 - Run -> NexusApplication
- Or using Maven:
 - `mvn spring-boot:run`

Check which port it runs on, and then open the URL `http://localhost:<port_number>` in your browser.

## Configuration
No configuration required, although you can modify in `src/main/resources/application.properties`: `server.port=8084`. This allows you to run it on the URL `http://localhost:8084` always.

## Usage
- Open Swagger UI at `http://localhost:<port_number>/swagger-ui/index.html`
- Try out the commands according to the API Reference table.

# Nexus-App
Nexus App is a minimal, backend-only chat platform built using Spring Boot. It is designed to mimic WhatsApp-like messaging functionality without a database. Instead, all the data (users, conversations, group chats, message metadata) is stored in JSON files.

Nexus App is a lightweight communication backend that supports:
- User registration and authentication
- One-on-one direct messaging (DM) between users

- Spring Web
- Spring Context
- Lombok
- Jackson (ObjectMapper for JSON)
### Frontend
- None (API-only backend)
- Swagger UI used for testing requests
### Database
- Pure JSON file storage
### Other Tools

- IntelliJ IDEA

## Screenshots / Demo
Pending video upload.

## Installation
Run the following commands in terminal.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/htserhsluk/Nexus-App
cd nexus-app
```

### 2. Ensure Java (atleast 17+) and Maven are installed
```java -version
mvn -version
```

### 3. Install Lombok plugin (IntelliJ)
- Go to File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Search "Lombok"
- Install and restart
- Enable annotation processing:
 - Settings -> Build -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors -> Enable

### 4. Run the application
- Using IntelliJL
 - Run -> NexusApplication
- Or using Maven:
 - `mvn spring-boot:run`

Check which port it runs on, and then open the URL `http://localhost:<port_number>` in your browser.

## Configuration
No configuration required, although you can modify in `src/main/resources/application.properties`: `server.port=8084`. This allows you to run it on the URL `http://localhost:8084` always.

## Usage
- Open Swagger UI at `http://localhost:<port_number>/swagger-ui/index.html`
- Try out the commands according to the API Reference table.
